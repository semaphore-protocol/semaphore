// The Semaphore circuit can be divided into 3 main parts.
// The first part involves the generation of the Semaphore identity,
// i.e. the public key and its hash, which is called the commitment
// and is used as a public value.
// In the second part, it is verified whether or not the identity commitment is part
// of the Merkle tree, i.e. the Semaphore group. That is, a proof of membership is verified.
// The third part covers the generation of a nullifier, i.e. the hash of the scope of the proof
// and the secret used to derive the public key (secret scalar). The nullifier is used to prevent the same
// proof from being verified twice.
// The circuit lastly includes the message, which is an arbitrary anonymous value defined by
// the user, or the hash of that value.

    // and by a specific identity, so that externally anyone can check if another proof with the same

    // where one wants to prevent double-spending or double-voting, for example.
