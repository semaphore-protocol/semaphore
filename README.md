# Semaphore

Semaphore is a zero-knowledge gadget which allows users to prove their
membership of a set without revealing their original identity. At the same
time, it allows users to signal their endorsement of an arbitrary string. It is
designed to be a simple and generic privacy layer for Ethereum dApps. Use cases
include private voting, whistleblowing, mixers, and anonymous authentication.
