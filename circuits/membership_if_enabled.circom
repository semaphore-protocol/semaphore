// Set membership gadget is handled with a multiplicative trick.
//
// For a given set of elements, a prover first computes the difference between
// each element in the set and the element they are proving knowledge of. We
// constrain this operation accordingly. We then multiply all differences and constrain
// this value by zero. If the prover actually knows an element in the set then for that
// element, it must hold that the difference is 0. Therefore, the product of 0 and
// anything else should be 0. The prove can't lie by adding a zero into the diffs set
// because we constrain those to match all elements in the set respectively.
