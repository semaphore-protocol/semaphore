# Semaphore groups

A [Semaphore group](/glossary/#group) contains [identity commitments](/glossary/#identity-commitment) of group members.
Example uses of groups include the following:

- poll question that attendees join to rate an event,
- ballot that members join to vote on a proposal,
- whistleblowers who are verified employees of an organization.

:::info
Semaphore V4 uses the [ZK-Kit](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zk-kit) LeanIMT (i.e., Lean Incremental
Merkle Tree) [Solidity](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zk-kit/tree/main/packages/imt.sol/contracts) and
[JavaScript](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zk-kit/tree/main/packages/imt) implementations for managing groups. Groups are Merkle trees, and the group members (i.e., identity commitments) are their leaves.

## Groups as anonymity sets

In Semaphore, groups serve as [anonymity sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity#Anonymity_and_pseudonymity) - the set of users among whom you are hiding when you generate a proof. The size of your group directly impacts the privacy protection you receive:

- **Larger groups** provide stronger anonymity because it's harder to identify which specific member created a proof
- **Smaller groups** provide weaker anonymity because there are fewer possible members to hide among

### Privacy and group size

When designing your application, consider the privacy requirements:

- **Groups with fewer than 10 members** provide minimal privacy protection
- **Groups with 50-100 members** are suitable for most organizational use cases (voting, feedback)
- **Groups with 500+ members** are recommended for high-stakes privacy applications (whistleblowing, sensitive signaling)
- **Groups with 1,000+ members** provide the strongest privacy for public applications

:::tip Privacy considerations
Group size is just one factor in maintaining privacy. For a comprehensive understanding of privacy in Semaphore, including timing attacks, metadata protection, and identity management, see the [privacy considerations guide](/guides/privacy-considerations).
:::

## Off-chain groups

Use the [`@semaphore-protocol/group`](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/blob/main/packages/group) package to manage off-chain groups.

### Install package

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  groupId="package-managers"
  values={[
{label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
{label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
{label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm'}
]}

  <TabItem value="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install @semaphore-protocol/group
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @semaphore-protocol/group
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add @semaphore-protocol/group
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
Semaphore also provides `@semaphore-protocol/core`, which includes the functions of the following core packages: `@semaphore-protocol/identity`, `@semaphore-protocol/group`, `@semaphore-protocol/proof`.
:::

### Create a group

To create a group instantiate `Group` without any parameters. For example:

```ts
import { Group } from "@semaphore-protocol/group"

const group1 = new Group()
```

You can also initialize a group with multiple members by passing the list of identity commitments as the first parameter when creating the group:

```ts
const members = [
  11237622825477336339577122413451117718539783476837539122310492284566644730311n,
  9332663527862709610616009715800254142772436825222910251631161087138559093425n,
  13255821893820536903335282929376140649646180444238593676033702344407594536519n
]

const group2 = new Group(members)
```

### Add members

Use the `addMember` method to add a member to a group. For example:

```ts
import { Identity } from "@semaphore-protocol/identity"

const { commitment } = new Identity()

group1.addMember(commitment)
```

To add a batch of members to a group, pass an array to the `addMembers` method. For example:

```ts
group1.addMembers(members)
```

:::caution Identity reuse across groups
When you use the same Semaphore identity across multiple groups:

1. **Security risk**: If an attacker obtains your private key, they can generate valid proofs in ALL groups where your commitment exists

2. **Privacy risk - Membership linking**: With on-chain groups, anyone can see that the same commitment appears in multiple groups, linking your memberships together

3. **Privacy risk - Activity linking**: If you use the same [scope](/glossary#scope) in different groups, your activities can be linked via identical [nullifiers](/glossary#nullifier). Using different scopes in different groups prevents this cryptographic linking

**Best practice**: Use different identities for different groups or contexts to maintain both security and privacy. See the [privacy considerations guide](/guides/privacy-considerations#risk-4-cross-group-identity-linking) for more details.
:::

### Remove or update members

To remove members from a group, pass the member index to the `removeMember` method. For example:

```ts
group.removeMember(0)
```

To update members in a group, pass the member index and the new value to the `updateMember` method. For example:

```ts
group.updateMember(0, 2n)
```

:::caution
Removing a member from a group sets its value to 0.
Given that the member isn't removed, the number of members (i.e., `group.size` on `group.members.length`) doesn't change.
:::

### Generate a Merkle proof

Semaphore groups are [Merkle trees](/glossary#merkle-tree), and it is therefore possible to calculate the Merkle proof of a group member (i.e., tree leaf) by passing the index of the member to the `generateMerkleProof`. For example:

```ts
group.generateMerkleProof(0)
```

## On-chain groups

Semaphore provides [`Semaphore.sol`](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/Semaphore.sol), a contract designed for managing on-chain groups ([deployed](/deployed-contracts) on major testnets).

Use the [`@semaphore-protocol/contracts`](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/blob/main/packages/contracts) package to import the `ISemaphore.sol` interface in your contract and start using its functions.

### Install package

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  groupId="package-managers"
  values={[
{label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
{label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
{label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm'}
]}
>
  <TabItem value="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install @semaphore-protocol/contracts
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @semaphore-protocol/contracts
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add @semaphore-protocol/contracts
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Create a group

To create a group initialize your contract with the `Semaphore.sol` address.
The `createGroup` function can be used to create a Semaphore group. For example:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.23;

import "@semaphore-protocol/contracts/interfaces/ISemaphore.sol";

contract YourContract {
    ISemaphore public semaphore;

    uint256 public groupId;

    constructor(ISemaphore _semaphore) {
        semaphore = _semaphore;

        groupId = semaphore.createGroup();
    }
}
```

`Semaphore.sol` also includes a mechanism to verify Semaphore proofs created with old Merkle tree roots, the duration of which can optionally be defined by the admin in the `createGroup` function. The default value duration is 1 hour and it should be fine for most use-cases. For more context see the issue [#98](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/issues/98).

### Add members

Use the `addMember` function to add a member to a group. For example:

```solidity
function addMember(uint256 identityCommitment) external {
    semaphore.addMember(groupId, identityCommitment);
}
```

To add a batch of members to a group, pass an array to the `addMembers` function. For example:

```solidity
function addMembers(uint256[] calldata identityCommitments) external {
    semaphore.addMembers(groupId, identityCommitments);
}
```

### Remove or update members

To update members in a group, pass the identity commitment of the member you want to update, its new identity commitment and the siblings of the Merkle proof for that member. For example:

```solidity
function updateMember(uint256 identityCommitment, uint256 newIdentityCommitment, uint256[] calldata merkleProofSiblings) external {
    semaphore.updateMember(groupId, identityCommitment, newIdentityCommitment, merkleProofSiblings);
}
```

:::info
To calculate the Merkle proof of a group member you can use the `generateMerkleProof` method of the JavaScript `Group` class described above.
:::

To remove members from a group, pass the identity commitment of the member you want to remove and the siblings of the Merkle proof for that member. For example:

```solidity
function removeMember(uint256 identityCommitment, uint256[] calldata merkleProofSiblings) external {
    semaphore.removeMember(groupId, identityCommitment, merkleProofSiblings);
}
```

:::info
If you want to see an example of a working contract, have a look at the [`contracts-hardhat`](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/tree/main/packages/cli-template-contracts-hardhat) CLI template. You can also create a project with that template by running `semaphore create my-app --template contracts-hardhat`.
