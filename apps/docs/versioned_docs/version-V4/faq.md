# FAQ

## Where can I ask questions about Semaphore?

You can ask questions about Semaphore on [Telegram](https://semaphore.pse.dev/telegram) or by opening a [Semaphore Discussion](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/discussions). The most frequent questions will be listed below.

## Why should I prevent proofs from being verified twice?

Since zero-knowledge proofs are completely anonymous, it is important to prevent those generated by eligible identities from being reused by a malicious party.

For example, in an anonymous voting application a valid proof could be reused to vote again.

## What is the difference between the "nullifier" and "scope"?

The [scope](/glossary#scope) is used like a topic on which users can generate a valid proof only once. The scope is a public value and every one can see what the scope of a proof is.

The [nullifier](/glossary#nullifier) is the hash of the private key of the identity and the scope, and it is used to check if the same proof with that specific scope has already been generated by the same user. The nullifier is also a public value and it is what is actually stored to prevent, for example, double-voting.

In the case of a voting application, if you have a group and you want all members of this group to vote only once, you can use the id of the group as the scope. When a user votes the first time, you can store the hash of voter's private key and the group id (i.e., the nullifier) and prevent double-voting by checking if that hash already exists.

See the [Semaphore circuits](/technical-reference/circuits) for more technical information, or the [Semaphore boilerplate](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/boilerplate/tree/main) for a real use-case.

## Where can I find examples of applications using Semaphore?

You can find a complete list of applications that are using Semaphore on the [Semaphore website](https://semaphore.pse.dev/projects).

## How can I start a project using Semaphore?

There are three ways you can start using Semaphore in your project: using the [CLI](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/tree/main/packages/cli), using the [boilerplate](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/boilerplate/tree/main) as a template or forking it, or installing the Semaphore [packages](/guides/identities) manually.

## What group size should I use for my application?

The group size you need depends on your privacy requirements. Here are some general guidelines:

-   **10-20 members**: Minimal privacy, suitable for small team feedback where anonymity is not critical
-   **50-100 members**: Adequate for most organizational use cases like internal voting or surveys
-   **500+ members**: Recommended for high-stakes privacy applications like whistleblowing
-   **1,000+ members**: Maximum privacy for public applications

Remember that larger groups provide stronger anonymity because it's harder to identify which specific member created a proof. For detailed guidance, see the [privacy considerations guide](/guides/privacy-considerations).

## How does Semaphore protect my privacy?

Semaphore uses zero-knowledge proofs to provide cryptographic privacy guarantees:

1. **Group membership privacy**: No one can determine which specific group member created a proof
2. **Message authenticity**: Only group members can create valid proofs
3. **Double-signaling prevention**: The nullifier system prevents the same identity from creating multiple proofs for the same scope
4. **Unlinkability across scopes**: Proofs from the same identity on different scopes cannot be linked together

However, Semaphore does NOT automatically protect against network-level metadata (like your IP address), transaction timing patterns, or message content that might reveal your identity. Use relays and follow best practices to maximize your privacy. See the [privacy considerations guide](/guides/privacy-considerations) for more details.

## What is an anonymity set and why does it matter?

An [anonymity set](/glossary#anonymity-set) is the group of users among whom you are hiding. In Semaphore, this is the [group](/glossary#group) your identity belongs to.

The anonymity set matters because it directly determines your privacy level:

-   In a group of 10 members, you're one of 10 possibilities (10% chance of identification)
-   In a group of 1,000 members, you're one of 1,000 possibilities (0.1% chance)

Larger anonymity sets make it exponentially harder for anyone to identify you. Always consider whether your group size provides adequate privacy for your use case.

## Should I use the same identity across multiple groups?

Generally, no. Using the same identity across multiple groups creates several risks:

1. **Security risk**: If an attacker compromises that identity, all groups it belongs to are affected
2. **Privacy risk - Membership linking**: With on-chain groups, anyone can see that the same commitment appears in multiple groups, linking your memberships
3. **Privacy risk - Activity linking**: If you use the same [scope](/glossary#scope) in different groups, your activities become linkable because nullifiers are computed as `Poseidon(scope, secret)` without the group ID

**Best practice**: Use different identities for different contexts or applications. If you must use the same identity, ensure each group uses unique scopes. If you're using deterministic identity generation (e.g., signing a message with MetaMask), ensure each application uses a unique message to generate different identities. See the [privacy considerations guide](/guides/privacy-considerations#risk-4-cross-group-identity-linking) for more information.

## Do I need to use a relay?

If privacy is important for your application, yes. A [relay](/glossary#relay) submits blockchain transactions on your behalf, preventing your Ethereum address from being publicly linked to your proofs.

**Without a relay**: Your wallet address is visible on-chain alongside your proof, allowing observers to link all your proofs together.

**With a relay**: The relay's address appears on-chain, not yours, preserving your anonymity.

Relays are essential for applications where users must remain anonymous, such as whistleblowing platforms or private voting systems. See the [privacy considerations guide](/guides/privacy-considerations#risk-1-transaction-linkability) for implementation guidance.

## Can someone identify me from my proof?

The zero-knowledge proof itself does not reveal your identity - it only proves you are a member of the group. However, you can be identified through:

1. **Message content**: If your message contains identifying information
2. **Transaction metadata**: If you submit proofs directly from your wallet without using a relay
3. **Timing patterns**: If you submit proofs immediately after specific events
4. **Small group size**: If the anonymity set is too small (e.g., fewer than 10 members)
5. **Cross-group linking**: If you use the same identity in multiple groups

To maximize privacy, use relays, large groups, avoid timing patterns, and never include identifying information in your messages. Read the [privacy considerations guide](/guides/privacy-considerations) for comprehensive guidance.

## How can I contribute to the protocol?

There are several ways you could contribute to the protocol, you can find more information about on [Github](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol#ways-to-contribute).
