## Transaction reverted when using the same nullifier

When you generate a proof using the same [scope](/glossary#scope) you used to validate a proof before, the transaction will be reverted because that scope (and thus the [nullifier](/glossary#nullifier)) has already been used. If you want to send and validate several proofs from the same identity, you need to use a different scope for each time you generate a proof.
