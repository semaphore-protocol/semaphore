# Semaphore identities

In order to join a [Semaphore group](/glossary#semaphore-group), a user must first create a [Semaphore identity](/glossary#semaphore-identity).
A Semaphore identity contains three values generated with the identity:

-   Private key
-   Public key
-   Commitment

To use and verify the identity, the identity owner (user) must know its private key.
To prevent fraud, the owner should keep their private key secret.

## Install library

In your code, use the [`@semaphore-protocol/identity`](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/tree/feat/semaphore-v4/packages/identity) library to manage Semaphore identites.

<Tabs
defaultValue="npm"
groupId="package-managers"
values={[
{label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
{label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
{label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm'}
]}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install @semaphore-protocol/identity
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @semaphore-protocol/identity
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm add @semaphore-protocol/identity
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Create identities

### Create random identities

To create a random identity, instantiate `Identity` without any parameters. For example:

```ts
import { Identity } from "@semaphore-protocol/identity"

const { privateKey, publicKey, commitment } = new Identity()
```

The new identity contains your private key, your public key, and its associated commitment, which serves as a public representation of the identity (similar to an Ethereum address).

### Create deterministic identities

If you pass a previously used private key or any secret value that acts as your private key as parameter, you can deterministically generate a Semaphore identity.

```ts
const identity1 = new Identity(privateKey)
// or
const identity2 = new Identity("secret-value")
```

:::tip
Building a system to save or recover secret values of Semaphore identities is nontrivial.
You may choose to delegate such functionality to existing wallets such as Metamask. For example:

1. In Metamask, a user signs a message with the private key of their Ethereum account.
2. In your application, the user creates a deterministic identity with the signed message.
3. The user can now recreate their Semaphore identity whenever they want by signing the same message with their Ethereum account in Metamask.
